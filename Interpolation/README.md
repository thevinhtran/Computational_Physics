Interpolation Exercises
  - Interpolation refers to supplementing existing discrete sets of data points with more points in between these existing points
    - For example, if need to draw continuous curve
  - Difference between this and curve fitting: interpolating function fits data points exactly, curve fitting doesn't, it minimizes
    instead like the chi squared error or something 
  
  - Polynomial, Splines, Rational Functions
